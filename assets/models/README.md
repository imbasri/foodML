# This is a placeholder file for the TensorFlow Lite model
# 
# In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Train a food classification model using TensorFlow/Keras
# 2. Convert it to TensorFlow Lite format (.tflite)
# 3. Place the actual model file here
#
# For now, the TFLiteService will handle the missing model gracefully
# and provide dummy predictions for demonstration purposes.
#
# You can download pre-trained food classification models from:
# - TensorFlow Hub: https://tfhub.dev/
# - Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/models
# - GitHub repositories with food classification models
#
# Common food classification models:
# - Food-101 (101 food categories)
# - Food Recognition models
# - Custom trained models on food datasets
